      <description>Malaria is a fatal disease caused by infected mosquitoes. It has remained with human in a long history and is one of the biggest causes of death especially in the tropical regions. Almost half of the worldâ€™s population, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is at the risk of catching Malaria. To gain more comprehension about this dreadful epidemic, 3 visualizations are created in this project based on the relevant datasets.</description>

      <description>In the era of big data, the overwhelming amount of data input can easily render popular statistical methods useless. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation algorithm (HMC) is one of such widely-applied MCMC simulation techniques, famous for its fast convergence speed and the ability to work with correlated samples. However, the algorithm requires to compute the gradient of the potential energy function, which can be computationally prohibitive due to immense datasets that are common nowadays.</description>
