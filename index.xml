      <description>Problem Problem 85: Counting rectangles
By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:
Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two million rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.
Analysis First of all, we need to specify the number of possible rectangles when the width and length of the grid are x units and y units.</description>

      <description>Problem Problem 31: Coin sums
In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p). It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?</description>

      <description>Problem Problem 25: 1000-digit Fibonacci number
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 1.
Hence the first 12 terms will be:
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(3) = 2
F(4) = 3
F(5) = 5
F(6) = 8
F(7) = 13
F(8) = 21
F(9) = 34
F(10) = 55
F(11) = 89
F(12) = 144</description>

      <description>In the era of big data, the overwhelming amount of data input can easily render popular statistical methods useless. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation algorithm (HMC) is one of such widely-applied MCMC simulation techniques, famous for its fast convergence speed and the ability to work with correlated samples. However, the algorithm requires to compute the gradient of the potential energy function, which can be computationally prohibitive due to immense datasets that are common nowadays.</description>
