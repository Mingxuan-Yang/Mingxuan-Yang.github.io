    <h2 id="introduction-to-hugo">Introduction to Hugo</h2>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With the ability of generating most websites within seconds, it provides the users with the world’s fastest framework for building personal websites.</p>
<p>The installation and deployment of Hugo are simple and efficient. With just 7 simple steps, we can easily use Hugo to build our own personal websites. Before introducing the 7 steps, the reader needs to get a Github account. The following instructions are based on the assumption that the users already have their personal Github accounts.</p>
<p>Github account is important, since it offers a static web hosting service called <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. If you don’t have a Github account, please go to the <a href="https://github.com">Github website</a> and create one.</p>
<p>Our goal in this blog is to start a personal website on Github Pages using Hugo.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-install-homebrew-and-go">Step 1: Install Homebrew and Go</h2>
<p>As a mac user, all of the following instructions will be based on macOS environment.</p>
<p>Before installing Hugo on macOS, <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> and <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> are needed. Homebrew is an open-source software package manager that makes it easier to install software on macOS and Linux, and Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. These are two important tools to install Hugo. If you already have them on your computer, you can skip to Step 2.</p>
<p>To install Homebrew, just paste the following code in a macOS Terminal.</p>
<pre><code>/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)&quot;
</code></pre><p>After installing Homebrew, we can run the following code in the macOS Terminal to install Go.</p>
<pre><code>brew install go
</code></pre><h2 id="step-2-install-hugo">Step 2: Install Hugo</h2>
<p>With the installation of Homebrew and Go, installing Hugo can be a simple task. Just type the following command in the Terminal.</p>
<pre><code>brew install hugo
</code></pre><p>If you are curious whether you have already installed Hugo, just check with the following code.</p>
<pre><code>hugo version
</code></pre><p>If something like this appears, the installation is successful.</p>
<pre><code>Hugo Static Site Generator v0.74.3/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown
</code></pre><h2 id="step-3-set-up-a-workplace">Step 3: Set up a workplace</h2>
<p>In this step, we need to build a directory to store our website, and the directory is based on our choice. For example, if we’d like to construct the website on our desktop, we can run the following code in the Terminal.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/Desktop
hugo new site mysite
</code></pre><p>If we can see the following result in the Terminal, the folder called <code>mysite</code> will appear on our desktop, and everything about our personal website will be stored in it.</p>
<pre><code>Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in ~/Desktop/mysite.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the &quot;hugo new theme &lt;THEMENAME&gt;&quot; command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with &quot;hugo new &lt;SECTIONNAME&gt;/&lt;FILENAME&gt;.&lt;FORMAT&gt;&quot;.
3. Start the built-in live server via &quot;hugo server&quot;.

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
</code></pre><p>The structure of our newly created <code>mysite</code> directory will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>~/Desktop/mysite
└───archetypes
│   └───default.md
└───config.toml
└───content
└───data
└───layouts
└───static
└───themes
</code></pre><p>The structure looks complicated, but a good thing is that we only need to focus on the <code>themes</code> folder at present. In the next step, we will choose the theme of our own personal website and use it to fill the <code>themes</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-choose-a-theme">Step 4: Choose a theme</h2>
<p>It is exciting to know that Hugo has already prepared for us with plenty of pre-made, open-sourced themes which are quite abundant and can satisfy most of our needs for building a personal website. With all of the themes provided at the official website <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io">Hugo themes</a>, what we should do first is selecting one that is appropriate for our usage. As for me, I chose <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-hyde">hyde-hyde theme</a> for my website.</p>
<p>After choosing the right theme, we can run the following command in our Terminal</p>
<pre><code>cd mysite
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/htr3n/hyde-hyde.git
</code></pre><p>The github link can be obtained at the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-hyde/#installation">Installation</a> part of hyde-hyde theme. The first two commands are aimed to go to the <code>themes</code> folder of our repository to store all of the items into it. Based on this objective, a simpler way is to download everything from the Github link to the <code>themes</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-create-my-website">Step 5: Create my website</h2>
<p>Now we have built the framework of our personal website, we can then set up some configurations or customizations. These manipulations can be done by adding or modifying stuffs in <code>config.toml</code> and folders other than <code>themes</code>. Or more simply, we can copy everything from the folder <code>exampleSite</code> to our directory. During this process, just overwrite any duplications.</p>
<p>To see what our website looks like currently, we can test the site locally by running the following commands.</p>
<pre><code>cd ..
hugo server
</code></pre><p>The Terminal will show like this</p>
<pre><code>                   | EN  
-------------------+-----
  Pages            | 47  
  Paginator pages  |  0  
  Non-page files   |  3  
  Static files     | 22  
  Processed images |  0  
  Aliases          |  1  
  Sitemaps         |  1  
  Cleaned          |  0

Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Press Ctrl+C to stop
</code></pre><p>According to the instructions, we can go to <em>http://localhost:1313/</em> through our web browser and our personal website will appear. Based on the result, we can also make some customized changes to the folders as well as <code> config.toml</code>. These changes are expected to appear at <em>http://localhost:1313/</em> immediately. When we finish testing, just press Ctrl+C to exit.</p>
<h2 id="step-6-host-on-github-pages">Step 6: Host on Github Pages</h2>
<p>To host my website on Github Pages, I need to firstly create a new github repository.</p>
<p>The process of creating Github repository can be shown below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get into the <strong>Repositories</strong> section at Github profile webpage.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>New</strong> button to create a new repository.</li>
<li>Fill the <strong>Repository name</strong> space according to the baseurl in <code>config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the third procedure, for example, my baseurl in <code>config.toml</code> is <em><a href="https://Mingxuan-Yang.github.io">https://Mingxuan-Yang.github.io</a></em>, then I will fill the <strong>Repository name</strong> space with <em>Mingxuan-Yang.github.io</em>.</p>
<p>Once we have created a Github repository, there will be a link started with https, which in my example is <em><a href="https://github.com/Mingxuan-Yang/Mingxuan-Yang.github.io.git">https://github.com/Mingxuan-Yang/Mingxuan-Yang.github.io.git</a></em>. Copy this link and we can turn to deploy our personal website to the Github Pages.</p>
<p>In the Terminal, run the following code:</p>
<pre><code>hugo
cd public
git init
git add .
git remote add origin https://github.com/Mingxuan-Yang/Mingxuan-Yang.github.io.git
git commit -m “first commit”
git push origin master
</code></pre><p>We are almost done! After successfully committed, we can go to the repository, which in this case is <em>Mingxuan-Yang.github.io</em>, and get into the <strong>Settings</strong> page. At the <strong>Github Pages</strong> section, we can find the link to our new website.</p>
<h2 id="step-7-update-website">Step 7: Update website</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to make some changes to the contents on your website, which is highly possible to happen, you can directly make changes in the website directory and then run the following code.</p>
<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m &quot;some changes&quot;
git push --set-upstream origin master
</code></pre><p>After about 10 minutes, the changes will appear on your personal website.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this tutorial. Now let&rsquo;s enjoy our fantastic website!</p>
