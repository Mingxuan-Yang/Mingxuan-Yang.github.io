    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease. Since its outbreak in December 2019 from Wuhan, China, it has presented the world with many political, scientific and public health challenges. Some researchers identified some important nutritional considerations for the prevention and management of COVID-19 diseases, including the role of select micronutri- ents (vitamins and minerals), phytochemicals and probiotics in conferring protection against both viral infection and pathogenicity. [1] As an international student from China, the origin of COVID-19, I&rsquo;m currently pursuing my master&rsquo;s degree in the United States, which is the country with most COVID-19 cases currently. This disease has exerted a great influence on me and my family. Therefore, I feel the necessity to carry out a project to analyze COVID-19, its economic influence and the potential dietary method to prevent it.</p>
<p>The major objective of this project is to explore the following persepective:</p>
<ul>
<li>The overall trend of COVID-19 development.</li>
<li>The transition of epidemic center since the outbreak of COVID-19.</li>
<li>The economic influence of COVID-19.</li>
<li>The important food products to help citizens to resist COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is mainly from a general perspective, with a little basic machine learning application. Thus the target audience is the general audience.</p>
<p>This project produces a dashboard and a jupyter notebook. The details about the machine learning appliations to find out the important food product to help citizens to resist COVID-19 are shown in the jupyter notebook. The dashboard is to present the information of COVID-19 and model results through visualiztion. For the whole project, my major contribution is to construct the whole dashboard using <code>streamlit</code> and <code>plotly</code>. This dashboard is deployed using <code>Heroku</code> and can be viewed <a href="https://covid-19-823.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. The details of the data products can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/Mingxuan-Yang/Biostat823-Final-Project">Github repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="datasets">Datasets</h2>
<p>This project involves the usage of the following three datasets.</p>
<ul>
<li>COVID-19 Datasets</li>
<li>Food Datasets</li>
<li>Economic Datasets</li>
</ul>
<p>The COVID-19 datasets are from <a href="https://dj2taa9i652rf.cloudfront.net/">Amazon Web Services (AWS) data lake</a>. This database is a centralized repository of up-to-date and curated datasets about COVID-19. It contains information about the cases and deaths of COVID-19 at country level and US state level. It also provides detailed information about the medical resources at US under this pandemic. This dataset is mainly used to construct the dashboard. To apply this dataset, SQL queries needs to be implemented to extract the needed part of the data lake and download to make use of.</p>
<p>The diet information and corresponding COVID-19 recovery rate data containing in the food datasets are from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset?select=Fat_Supply_Quantity_Data.csv">Kaggle</a>. This dataset is employed to find out the important food product to help citizens to resist COVID-19 using machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>The economic datasets, representing the economic impacts of COVID-19 denoted by GDP growth rate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20">G20 countries</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven">G7 countries</a>, are provided by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The G20 is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union (EU). The Group of Twenty (G20) is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union (EU). Its members represent 85 percent of global economic output. The Group of Seven (G7) is an intergovernmental organization consisting of 7 countries. It is mainly about political issues and represents 58% of the global net wealth. For the study of economic field, these groups are great representatives.</p>
<h2 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h2>
<p>The structure of dashboard is shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Welcome!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Overview</strong>
<ul>
<li>Worldwide Overview</li>
<li>Bar Chart Race</li>
<li>Individual Country</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Economic Perspective</strong>
<ul>
<li>G20</li>
<li>G7</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dietary Perspective</strong>
<ul>
<li>EDA</li>
<li>Model</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Welcome!</strong> section serves as a front page of the whole project. It provides an introduction about the whole project as well as the relevant datasets.</p>
<p>The <strong>Overview</strong> section contains three parts. The first part is the Worldwide Overview. In this small section, two figures about COVID-19 are provided. The first figure shows the total cases and deaths around the world. This indicates the overall trend of COVID-19 for different seasons and the whole severity. As can be seen from the figure, the growth rate of COVID-19 seems to be increasing in terms of total cases around the world.</p>
<p><img src="/img/covid-19-1.png" alt="error"></p>
<p>The second figure is the geographical distribution of COVID-19, represented by different measure of severity and calculation method. This offers a reference about which region around the world should the World Health Organization pays more attention to.</p>
<p><img src="/img/covid-19-2.png" alt="error"></p>
<p>The second part of <strong>Overview</strong> section is about a bar chart race. As shown below, the bar chart race shows the transition of epidemic center since its outbreak. The final result is that from Feburary 1, 2020 to November 7, 2020, the epidemic center has been moved from China, the origin of COVID-19, to USA, the country with most total cases and deaths according to the Woldwide Overview section.</p>
<iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/4299524/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;'></iframe><div style='width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;'><a class='flourish-credit' href='https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4299524/?utm_source=embed&utm_campaign=visualisation/4299524' target='_top' style='text-decoration:none!important'><img alt='Made with Flourish' src='https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg' style='width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;'> </a></div>
           
<p>The final part of <strong>Overview</strong> section provides the COVID-19 situation for each individual country around the world. Similar to the Worldwide Overview part, the COVID-19 situation is represented by the toal cases and total deaths of each country. The details can be viewed at the <a href="https://covid-19-823.herokuapp.com/">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Economic Perspective</strong> section roughly reveals the economic influence of COVID-19, denoted by the GDP growth rate since its outbreak at country level. In this post I only introduce the condition of G20 group in the first quarter of 2020 as an example. The GDP growth rate of G20 countries are shown below. China, according to the figure, is mostly influenced by COVID-19 from the perspective of economy. Five countries within the G20 group have positive GDP growth rate, indicating that the global impact of COVID-19 is not so severe at this time.</p>
<p><img src="/img/covid-19-3.png" alt="error"></p>
<p>The <strong>Dietary Perspective</strong> is trying to figure out the important food products to help citizens to resist COVID-19. The important food products are determined using different machine learning models. This part of the dashboard provides the exploratory data analysis (EDA), and also exhibits the model performance in terms of feature importance and prediction error.</p>
<p>The EDA parts are implemented by the scatter plots revealing the relationship between predictors (food products) and outcome (COVID-19 recovery rate), as well as the relationship between different predictors. The example figures are shown below. The relationship between predictors and outcome doesn&rsquo;t seem to be linear. Therefore, tree-based models are expected to have better performance.</p>
<p><img src="/img/covid-19-5.png" alt="error"></p>
<p><img src="/img/covid-19-6.png" alt="error"></p>
<p>The model results are shown in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>
<p>In this part, the machine learning methods used to figure out the important food products to help increasing COVID-19 recovery rate are detailed introduced. First of all, we need to explain the reasons why to choose COVID-19 recovery rate as the outcome variable rather than the proportion of COVID-19 patients. The focus of our study is the potential positive effect of food products. However, the proportion of COVID-19 patients is more influenced by the policy, like whether the government has issued stay at home order, mask wearing order, business suspension order etc. And food products are more related to the nutrition taking, which is expected to correlate with the immune system.</p>
<p>The models applied in this project are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Random Forest Regression</li>
<li>Elastic Net Regression</li>
<li>Gradient Boosting Regression</li>
</ul>
<p>This part is completed by my teammates, and the theoretical foundation can be found at our report. In this post I will present the final results of the models, which contains the prediction MSE, the running time, as well as the top 3 most important food products. The results are shown below.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on this project, the key findings about COVID-19 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The growth rate of COVID-19 is increasing in terms of total cases around the world.</li>
<li>Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the epidemic center has been moved from China, the origin of COVID-19, to USA, the country with most total cases and deaths.</li>
<li>COVID-19 has greatly influenced the global economy in a negative direction.</li>
<li>Random Forest has the best performance among the three models being tested in finding out the relationship between the recovery rate of COVID-19 and food products. According to Random Forest Regression, the most important foods are milk, vegetal products and cereals.</li>
