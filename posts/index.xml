      <description>Malaria is a fatal disease caused by infected mosquitoes. It has remained with human in a long history and is one of the biggest causes of death. Almost half of the world’s population, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is at the risk of catching Malaria. To gain more comprehension about this powerful enemy, the Wellcome Trust and Sage Bionetworks have hosted a Data Challenge based on the relevant Malaria datasets.</description>

      <description>Problem Problem 85: Counting rectangles
By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:
Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two million rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.
Analysis First of all, we need to specify the number of possible rectangles when the width and length of the grid are x units and y units.</description>

      <description>Problem Problem 31: Coin sums
In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p). It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?</description>

      <description>Problem Problem 25: 1000-digit Fibonacci number
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 1.
Hence the first 12 terms will be:
F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(3) = 2
F(4) = 3
F(5) = 5
F(6) = 8
F(7) = 13
F(8) = 21
F(9) = 34
F(10) = 55
F(11) = 89
F(12) = 144</description>
